    <meta name="description" content="ChainID: AI-Powered Biometric Authentication on Blockchain
    ChainID is a next-gen authentication system that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain to deliver secure, decentralized biometric login. Instead of relying on vulnerable passwords or centralized databases, ChainID uses facial and fingerprint recognition powered by machine learning to verify users. Biometric data is hashed and stored on a local blockchain ledger using secure SHA-256 encryption and JWT authentication, ensuring tamper-proof access and full user privacy. Built using Python (Flask), JavaScript (React), and MySQL, ChainID enables seamless integration for web apps, fintech platforms, and government services. Its lightweight REST API allows developers to deploy within days and avoid third-party authentication services. Designed for real-world use in banking, healthcare, e-governance, and enterprise environments, ChainID outperforms traditional login systems like Google Authenticator and Face ID by offering decentralized control and enhanced data security. Whether you're building secure platforms or looking to eliminate password-based vulnerabilities, ChainID offers the perfect fusion of AI and blockchain for modern authentication.">
